                    Terms, cease using

                <p class="font-bold">These terms also include certain liability limitations and legal disclaimers that
                    limit our
                    liabilities.
                    In other words,
                    your use of the Service is at your own risk and we do not assume any liability, or make any

                <h1 class="mb-[15px]">1. Eligibility and Accounts</h1>
                <p>a. Use of the Service is not permitted where prohibited by law. Without limiting the foregoing, you
                    represent and
                    warrant that you are not located in a country that is subject to international or applicable
                    embargo, or
                    a country that
                    has been designated by the international or applicable law as a “terrorist supporting” country and
                    that
                    you are not
                    listed on any applicable list of prohibited or restricted parties.</p>
                <p>b. You must be at least eighteen (18) years of age to use the Service. If you are under eighteen (18)
                    years old, you are
                    not permitted to use the Service and you must immediately cease using the Service, regardless of
                    parental authorization.</p>
                <p>c. You may be required, from time to time and in our discretion, to create an account with us (an
                    “Account”) to use
                    parts of the Service to its fullest extent. In such cases: You represent and warrant that all
                    information that you
                    provide to us in creating your Account is complete and accurate. You shall update such information
                    when
                    it changes or
                    when we request. You acknowledge that we may also access, with your permission, personally
                    identifiable
                    information
                    through a third-party or other means based on the permissions you provide. You shall not use another
                    person or entity’s
                    Account without authorization or access the accounts of any other person on any other systems. You

                    be solely
                    responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of and restricted access to your Account. You shall
                    be
                    solely
                    responsible for all activities that occur under your Account. You shall notify us immediately of any
                    breach of security
                    or unauthorized use of your Account. Pursuant to the terms herein, we shall not be liable for any
                    losses
                    resulting from
                    any unauthorized use of your Account and, in addition to the further indemnification herein, you
                    hereby
                    indemnify us and
                    hold us harmless for any such unauthorized use. You acknowledge and understand that anyone who gains
                    access to your
                    Account will gain access to your all of your data on your Account, including any private content.

                <p>d. The consideration for your knowing acceptance of these Terms is that we are providing you the
