                <p>This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of information that we gather when you are accessing or
                    using
                    our Services.
                    This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control (including,
                    without limitation,
                    the third party content providers from whom you may receive content through the Services), or to
                    individuals that we do
                    not employ or manage.</p>
                <p>Company does not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Information from anyone under the age of 13 or
                    knowingly allow
                    such persons to register. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Website or

                    collected
                    personal
                    information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that
                    information as
                    quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under
                    13,

                <h1 class="mb-[15px]">III. WHAT INFORMATION DOES Ytube2dDownloader COLLECT?</h1>
                <p>The information we collect can be generally placed in two categories: 1) data on how the user uses
                    our
                    Services; 2)
                    aggregate data on content the user engages with. We may use this information to personalize and
                    improve
                    our services, to
                    fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you use the Services. We
                    may
                    provide this
                    information to our partners, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal experience, but we
                    never
                    disclose
                    information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally. Here are a few examples of
                    data
                    we collect when
                    you use our Services:</p>
